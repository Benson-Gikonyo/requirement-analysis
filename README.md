#Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive foundation for the airbnb clone application by documenting, analysing and structuring requirements. This repository is dedicated to documenting and exploring the process of requirement analysis in software development. It covers techniques, examples, and best practices for gathering, analyzing, and managing software requirements.

##What is Requirement Analysis?
requirement analysis is the crucial foundational process of identifying, documenting, validating, and refining the needs and expectations of stakeholders to create a clear blueprint for a new or altered software system. It involves understanding what a system must do (functional requirements) and the constraints it must operate within (non-functional requirements), ensuring the final product aligns with business goals and user expectations. This phase prevents misunderstandings, costly rework, and ensures project success by establishing a well-defined set of requirements before development begins.
 

##Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

    Reduces Risk:
    Early identification and analysis of requirements minimize the risk of misunderstandings that can lead to costly delays and rework later in the project. 

**Ensures Alignment**:
It ensures that the final software product will meet the needs of both the users and the business goals, fostering satisfaction and project success. 
**Provides a Blueprint**:
The documented requirements act as a clear roadmap for the development team, guiding the design, coding, and testing phases. 
**Facilitates Communication**:
A well-defined set of requirements reduces communication gaps and conflicts between different teams and stakeholders. 

##Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. Requirement Gathering

-Collects high-level requirements from stakeholders, clients, and end users.

-Focuses on understanding the goals, expectations, and business needs.

-Methods include interviews, surveys, questionnaires, and reviewing existing documents.

-Helps create a broad picture of what the system should achieve.

2. Requirement Elicitation

-A deeper process of drawing out detailed requirements from stakeholders.

-Involves active communication and engagement to uncover both stated and hidden needs.

-Techniques include workshops, brainstorming sessions, focus groups, and observation.

-Ensures requirements are not assumed but explicitly clarified.

3. Requirement Documentation

-Formalizes gathered and elicited requirements into a structured format.

-Uses documents such as Software Requirement Specification (SRS) or user stories.

-Provides a reference point for developers, testers, and project managers.

-Ensures traceability by recording requirements clearly and unambiguously.

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling

-Examines requirements to detect conflicts, overlaps, and feasibility issues.

-Breaks down complex requirements into manageable components.

-Uses models such as use case diagrams, data flow diagrams, and prototypes for visualization.

-Helps both technical and non-technical stakeholders understand system behavior.

5. Requirement Validation

-Confirms that documented requirements reflect stakeholder needs correctly.

-Ensures completeness, consistency, and alignment with business objectives.

-Activities include walkthroughs, reviews, and prototyping.

-Prevents costly errors by detecting issues early in the software development lifecycle.
